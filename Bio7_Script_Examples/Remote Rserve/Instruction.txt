!Description for a remote R running on a Linux computer

Move Rserv.conf to Linux System folder /etc  (/etc/Rserv.conf)
The file references the password file (pass.txt) which can be placed
in a custom location. Please change this file with the correct
file location on your computer!

Start R and then load the Rserve library
#######R commands start########
library(Rserve);
Rserve();
#######R commands end##########

Under the R preferences of Bio7 enable the remote connection with 
the correct ip-adress, user and password information!!!

Start Rserve without a native connection (not default - please change in the Rserve preferences!)

If you want to work with the local connection please stop and close the remote
connection before you start the local connection!

Please consider that you are working on a remote maschine. The open and save
dialogs will not work but you can save workspaces etc. with the file paths
of the remote computer.

Generally the shell, the editor and image analysis tools will work with the remote
connection

If you use the flow you can use Groovy or BeanShell scripts to evaluate
R scripts since. Dragged Rscripts will use the local file path which causes errors!

If you use the print method the results will be shown on the remote shell!
e.g.: 
#######R commands start########
result<-runif(1:100);
print(result);
#######R commands end##########

If a network connection is not available the job will run for a longer time since
it tries to find a connection to the remote computer or server!
You can stop this process as usual but this action will be recognized at the next
available opportunity!

Troubleshooting:
- If you can't get a connection please control if not to many Rserve processes are running
  (Rserve-bin.so)
- Please verify the entries (user, pass, Rserv.conf, pass.txt) on both sides etc.
