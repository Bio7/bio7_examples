# Examples for Bio7

**Download ZIP (see 'Clone or Download' action):**

You can download the examples here as a *.zip file and import them into Bio7 (File->Import->Existing Projects into Workspace->Select archive file).  
For the Java examples the local paths will be automatically (if confirmed) recalculated derived from the Bio7 installation folder.

**Clone (see 'Clone or Download' action):**

If you import the examples as a Github repository some paths of the examples have to be adapted
because the paths of your local Github repository could differ from the Bio7 installation path.
Please control the paths.
